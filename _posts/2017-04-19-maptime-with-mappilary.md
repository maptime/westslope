Join us for another #Maptime on April 19th at The Point (1455 N 12th St, Grand Junction, CO)

We will be collecting open source street view data for Open Street Map using the app Mapillary (http://mapillary.com)
All participants will receive a bike or car phone mount designed specifically for capturing street view photos with your smart phone!

Please bring a bicycle or car, download Mapillary on your phone, and create a Mapillary account prior to the event.

Join us afterwards for a beer at The Point!

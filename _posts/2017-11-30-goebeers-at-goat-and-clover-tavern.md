Hi Maptimers and Mappers!

Please join us for GeoBeers this Thursday (Sorry for the short notice!!)
A representative of Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOT) is in Grand Junction and we decided to do a spur of the moment event. 

Where: 336 Main St
Grand Junction, CO 81501

When: 7pm Thursday November 30th

Why: Because we love beer, mapping, and advancing the common good!

What: Join us for a beer or two to talk about OpenStreetMap and Humanitarian Mapping, an easy and helpful way you can volunteer your time, from the comfort of your home! This is an informal event and we will mainly be disseminating information as opposed to doing a specific project.

Current Humanitarian OpenStreetMap projects include Caribbean Hurricane response, Bangladeshi Flood response, Central American Earthquake response, and many many more!
